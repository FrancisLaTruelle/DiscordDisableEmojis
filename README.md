# Discord Disable Emojis
Very simple module that allows you to disable emojis (in reactions or in messages) with Discord v12

# Installation
To install this module type the following command in your console:
```
npm i discord-disable-emojis
```

# Warning
Be careful to respect these things for the module to work correctly:

  - For the list of banned emojis, you must use ðŸ™‚ and not :slight_smile: for example
  - Go to the configuration of your bot on your control panel of your Discord applications. You must activate the "Privileged Gateway Intents": activate "Presence Intent" and "Server Members Intent"
  - Don't forget to put the partial configuration in your client's definition in your code


# Example
Example of a basic bot handling reactions and messages using this module.
```js

const Discord = require("discord.js")
const client = new Discord.Client({
    partials: ['MESSAGE', 'REACTION'] // Remember to include this line otherwise the reactions are not detected
});

const disableEmojis = require("discord-disable-emojis")

client.on('ready', async () => {
    disableEmojis(client, {
    // WARNING: For the you must use ðŸ™‚ and not :slight_smile: for example
        disabledEmojisMessage: [ // Add as many emoji you want banned in messages
            "ðŸ’©",
            "ðŸ–•"
        ],
        disabledEmojisReaction: [ // Add as many emoji you want banned in reactions
            "ðŸ’©",
            "ðŸ–•"
        ],
        DMwarnEmojisMessage: ":shield: **|** You are not allowed to use this emoji in your message !", // The message that the bot will send in DM to the user who uses a forbidden emoji in a message. Delete this line or enter "None" for any message sent
        DMwarnEmojisReaction: ":shield: **|** You are not allowed to use this emoji in reaction !" // The message that the bot will send in DM to the user who reacts with a forbidden emoji. Remove this line or enter "None" for any message sent
    })

    // Rest of your code
})

client.on('message', message => client.emit('checkEmojisMessage', message)) // This line is used to send the module the necessary information when a message is sent
client.on('messageReactionAdd', (messageReaction, user) => client.emit('checkEmojisReaction', messageReaction, user)) // This line is used to send the module the necessary information when a reaction is added

client.login("YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN")
```
